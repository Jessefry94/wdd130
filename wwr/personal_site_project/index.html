                    Our goal at “Fresh Start” is to bring health back into your daily life. We are often busy advancing our careers and taking care of other responsibilities that we find ourselves putting our own personal needs on the back burner. Creating a healthy lifestyle isn’t only about eating and exercise, but creating a strong positive attitude, a healthy self-image, and a healthy mind-set. My hope is to provide information and ideas to get your started on your journey to a better you. Let’s get started!

                <p>
                    Start Now by Drinking More Water! “Most of us don’t drink enough water every day, but it is essential for our bodies to work properly. Water is absolutely necessary for carrying out our bodily functions, removing waste, and transporting nutrients and oxygen throughout our bodies. Since water is expelled every day through urination, bowel movements, perspiration and breathing, we need to replenish the amount of water in our bodies constantly. The amount of water we need depends on a variety of factors, but generally an average adult needs two to three liters a day. A good way to tell if you are getting enough water is by your urine—which should be either colorless or pale yellow.”

                <p>
                    Sleep is necessary for daily activity and function. The recommended amount of sleep is 8 hours a day. For most people, sleeping for 6 hours or less can cause impairment to your mind and body.
