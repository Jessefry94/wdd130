                        Start with what you can do at home or outside. For many of us, lifting our body weight is more than enough for greater health. Some healthy choices to increase body strength and endurance are push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, squats, lunges, and planks. Having the ability to lift your own weight is essential to keeping yourself safe. If an unfortunate circumstance was to come about, being able to lift yourself to safety could save your life.
