        [Our Goal!
        My purpose of “Fresh Start” is to bring health back into your daily life. We are often busy advancing our careers and taking care of other responsibilities that we find ourselves putting our own personal needs on the back burner. Creating a healthy lifestyle isn’t only about eating and exercise, but creating a strong positive attitude, a healthy self-image, and a healthy mind-set. My hope is to provide information and ideas to get your started on your journey to a better you. Let’s get started!
        
        Start Now by Drinking More Water
        “Most of us don’t drink enough water every day, but it is essential for our bodies to work properly. Water is absolutely necessary for carrying out our bodily functions, removing waste, and transporting nutrients and oxygen throughout our bodies. Since water is expelled every day through urination, bowel movements, perspiration and breathing, we need to replenish the amount of water in our bodies constantly. The amount of water we need depends on a variety of factors, but generally an average adult needs two to three liters a day. A good way to tell if you are getting enough water is by your urine—which should be either colorless or pale yellow.”
        
        Proper Sleep
        Sleep is necessary for daily activity and function. The recommended amount of sleep is 8 hours a day. For most people, sleeping for 6 hours or less can cause impairment to your mind and body.]

        [Healthy Habits for Your Physical and Mental Health
        Our bodies need daily exercise. To create strong bodies and minds we need to exercise. The best way to get started is to incorporate our daily needs into daily activities. Some examples could be walking your dog, walking to work, walking to school, walking to the gym, or playing a sport. Choose what items best fit your needs

        Body workouts
        Start with what you can do at home or outside. For many of us, lifting our body weight is more then enough to greater health. Some healthy choices to increase body strength and endurance are push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, squats, lunges, and planks. Having the ability to lift your own weight is essential to keeping yourself safe. If an unfortunate circumstance was to come about, being able to lift yourself to safety could save your life. 

        “Eating Healthy”
        Keeping a consistent diet of healthy foods while maintaining a healthy amount of calorie intake will help you stay at a healthy weight. Remember to eat fruits and vegetables and find a good source for protein This can be done through calorie tracking. An app called “Loose it!” is a good resource to tract your calorie intake.]

        [ Finding the strength to give up unhealthy choices
        Saying no is hard. We often find ourselves indulging in foods or beverages that provide no health benefits. To improve our health, we must be able to say, “no” to unhealthy life style choices. These choices could be, but are not limited to, smoking, alcohol, drugs, drinks high in sugar, drinks high in caffeine, and sweets. 

        Learning to Put Yourself First
        Giving up drugs, alcohol, and smoking is no easy task. I would recommend seeing an addiction recovery therapist. Having someone to talk to will help you feel understood and will push you towards your personal goals. By giving up these drugs you will have self-control, you will have better skin, you will have reduced blood pressure, a stronger heart, stronger lungs, weight loss, improved memory, deeper sleep, a better immune system, and a better mood. 

        Things to consider
        Some ways to improve your health are to reduce sugar/caffeine intake. Too much sugar and caffeine can cause imbalances to your health. Sugar can cause high blood pressure, weight gain, diabetes, liver dieses, inflammation, and an increased risk to heart attacks and strokes. Too much caffeine can cause headaches, anxiety, trouble sleeping, irritability, respiratory issues, chest pain, and thirst.]
