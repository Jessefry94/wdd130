    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Jesse Fry</h2>
    <p>I am persuing a Software Engineering degree. I am interested in web design to increase my skill set. 
        I am currently married to my wife, Sarah. We have been married for 4 years. 
        I do not have a job at the moment, but I have been contemplating on getting one. </p>
    <p>One thing I love about BYU-Idaho is additional help towards students. 
        I belive learning about web design will improve my skill set and make me a more valuable employee. 
        I also find coding interesting. I have been a member my whole life. I was baptised when I was 8 years old.
        A scripture I like is John 10:18. </p>
    <p>I love art and music. I find anime to be very bueatiful. The ability to draw something and have it take a life of its own is facinating.</p>
